### Minimal Theme | Dark Mode

This GitHub page template was forked from [evanca](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio) based on the Minimal theme from [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal)

The original version of the minimal theme is in light mode. So, I made some modifications to create this dark mode.

### Forking Cautions

You can fork this repo to create your GitHub page, BUT:
- Make sure to **remove the google analytics tracking ID** in `_config.yml`. Otherwise, it will affect my google analytics for sure.
- Please **remove all my works/ portfolio**, such as data viz, dashboard, etc
- **Change the title** to your own title in `_layouts/default.html`
- **Change the favicon** to your own icon in `images/favicon-solid.png`
- **Change the logo** to your own logo/ photo in `images/logo-avatar.png`
- **Change the preview image** to your own image in `images/preview-image.png` (it contains my face, please remove it)
